# BitCoin-Trial
This project is trying to implement some Bitcoin trading strategies to explore the new possibilities.

### Strategies List
Currently, there're 5 plans in the to-do list:

1. **Momentum Trading**: trivial and easy.
2. **Pairs Trading**: trivial, and just like what says in Zhihu.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: may need a little discussion about its details and optimization.
4. **HMM**: it just gives the framework of HMM. So hard part is we need to build a complete HMM with all the details accurate defined. 
5. **MCMC(Markov Chain Monte Carlo)**: this is NOT trivial. It involves the sampling, Brownian motion, and Bayesian method. I only can understand its framework. I may learn the details from you. And I think the details require our deep discussion.
